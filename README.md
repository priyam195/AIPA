Project Description: The AI-Powered Team Productivity Assistant (AIPA) is a hackathon project that aims to develop a conversational chatbot using a generative AI large language model (LLM). The goal of this project is to create a subject matter expert chatbot that can significantly enhance the productivity of individuals within teams by providing quick and accurate answers to technical questions and facilitating easy access to relevant documents and resources. AIPA will learn from the vast amount of documents stored in various team workspaces, including SharePoint, Microsoft Teams, common folders, and other shared locations like Outlook.
